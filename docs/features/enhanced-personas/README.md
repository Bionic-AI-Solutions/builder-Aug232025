  user: User;
  persona: 'super_admin' | 'builder' | 'end_user';
  permissions: string[];
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
}
```

#### Persona-Specific State
```typescript
interface BuilderState {
  projects: Project[];
  implementations: Implementation[];
  revenue: RevenueData;
  customers: Customer[];
}

interface EndUserState {
  widgets: Widget[];
  usage: UsageData;
  billing: BillingData;
}
```

### API Integration

#### Enhanced API Calls
- Persona-based API routing
- Role-based access control
- Multi-tenant data filtering
- Real-time updates for implementations

#### New API Endpoints
- `/api/builders/*` - Builder-specific APIs
- `/api/end-users/*` - End-user specific APIs
- `/api/widgets/*` - Widget management APIs
- `/api/admin/builders` - Builder management (admin)
- `/api/admin/implementations` - Implementation tracking (admin)

## User Experience

### Builder Experience

## Security Considerations

### Data Isolation
- Builder data isolated from other builders
- End-user data isolated per implementation
- Super admin can access all data
- API endpoints enforce data boundaries

### Access Control
- Role-based API access
- Persona-based UI elements
- Multi-tenant data filtering
- Audit logging for all operations

### Revenue Security
- Secure payment processing
- Revenue attribution accuracy
- Fraud prevention measures
- Financial reporting compliance

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Persona-based access control
- Data isolation per tenant
- Revenue calculation accuracy
- API endpoint authorization

### Integration Tests
- Multi-tenant data flow
- Revenue tracking accuracy
- Widget implementation flow
- Payment processing

### End-to-End Tests
- Builder workflow (create ‚Üí publish ‚Üí monetize)
- End-user workflow (browse ‚Üí purchase ‚Üí implement)
- Admin workflow (monitor ‚Üí manage ‚Üí report)

## Success Metrics

### Builder Metrics
- Number of active builders
- Average revenue per builder
- Project publication rate
